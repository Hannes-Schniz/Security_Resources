# Introduction
Human errors have in most Industries irreversible impacts. An carpenter can cut a piece of plywood wrong, which cannot be undone. In IT this is different. Most mundane tasks on the computer are reversible. Be it a typo, wrong entry in a database or the enabling of wrong settings. These actions can all be undone. Some with more and some with less effort.
Many small mistakes that appear meaningless and are easily reversible from the perspective of the user are abused by actors with malicious intent. These actors prey on their victims to click on links, download Data or simply tell them what they need to know. These seemingly small mistakes with often times no immediate feedback are a leading cause of Data Breaches, Attacks and Compromises. In the following I will talk about how the human judgment is the most important security feature companies have and should invest in. 

# Data breaches
In the yearly investigation published by Vorizon on Data breachesÂ¹, it was found, that 68% of data breaches in the year 2024 involved a human element. In what way a human was involved is not further specified. Furthermore 28% of breaches involved errors. These errors can come from an End-user just as well as an Developer or System Admin. Vorizon concludes, that 87% of breaches that were caused by errors were due to End-users. In contrast system administrators accounted for only 11% of errors.
