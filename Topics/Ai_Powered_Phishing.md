# Introduction
AI is often praised as a incredible new technology that will solve all of humanities problems. While one part of this sentence is true this article will shine light on "new" problems that arise with AI.  New technologies have always been used as weapons or to enable criminals, especially in the Cyber space. We can see this trend with upcoming technologies in the last years where the blockchain has befrauded more people than any company could. It is a very similar story with AI. 

# What is AI?
AI or Artificial Intelligence as we know and use it today is a set of algorithms that try to form statistical connections over a given dataset.  This has been done for a long time by big Tech corporations like Google or Facebook who store vast amounts of data on their customers to build ad profiles. But why do we hear about AI so much today?
AI as we know it was made accessible to a broader public in recent years. Today you can open your browser and let ChatGPT write your essay, let DeepAI generate some pictures and ask Github Copilot for help when you are writing code. This accessibility is what pushed AI in the focus of the public.
With these new tools you can generate human like Outputs that get increasingly real with a greater amount of input data. But contrary to what the name would suggest, AI is not intelligent. AI as use it today will never generate something uniquely new. It only takes input data and generates an average that is most likely to answer the prompt it was given. 
This is not only a problem where pictures will be distorted but in IT as well. If you generate code with ChatGPT you will never get a unique piece of code that is tailored to your usecase. You will get a mashup of code that has been determined to be most likely what you asked for in your prompt.
